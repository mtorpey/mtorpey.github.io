We give a complete description of the congruence lattices of the following
finite diagram monoids: the partition monoid, the planar partition monoid, the
Brauer monoid, the Jones monoid (also known as the Temperley--Lieb monoid), the
Motzkin monoid, and the partial Brauer monoid. All the congruences under
discussion arise as special instances of a new construction, involving an ideal
$I$, a retraction $I \to M$ onto the minimal ideal, a congruence on $M$, and a
normal subgroup of a maximal subgroup outside $I$.
