This is a list of all the conferences, workshops and meetings I have attended in
my research career.  The dates shown for an event are the dates I was there, a
subset of the whole event.
The date format is
[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals),
which everyone should use.
